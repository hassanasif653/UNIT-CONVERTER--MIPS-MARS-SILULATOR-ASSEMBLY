9-in-1 Unit Converter | MIPS Assembly Language Project.....

📚 About This Project:

This project was developed as a 3rd semester academic assignment for the Assembly Language Programming course or CALD.
It is a 9-in-1 Unit Converter built using MIPS Assembly Language, tested on simulators like MARS.

🚀 Features
Interactive, menu-driven interface

Supports 9 types of conversions:

Temperature

Length

Mass

Time

Area

Volume

Speed

Energy

Also contain Multiple unit options under each conversion type

Efficient use of loops, conditions, branching, and system calls

Clean input validation and output formatting. It is Modular and well-commented code

📋 How It Works:

The user selects a conversion category from the main menu.

Then chooses source and target units.

Enters the value to be converted.

The program calculates and displays the result.

Designed using modular labels and branching for easy navigation.

🛠 Technologies Used:

Programming Language: MIPS Assembly Language

Simulator: MARS / QtSPIM

🖥️ Setup Instructions:

Download and install a MIPS Simulator (MARS or QtSPIM).

Load the .asm file into the simulator.

Assemble and run the program.

Follow on-screen instructions to perform conversions.

🔥 Highlights:

Demonstrates real-world problem-solving using Assembly.

Strengthens skills in registers, branching, system calls, and arithmetic.

Educational design for better learning and understanding.

Clean, modular, and easy-to-read code structure.
